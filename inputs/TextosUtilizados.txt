I liked their food, style, and service so much. It's much better than other famous restaurants around here. Definitely come back again! The fish was fresh, salad was great and different (with carrots and onions), and the plate was big enough for the food. The dressing options are good. People working here are also so nice. I had a good time here. Also, there is enough parking space for cars and bikes.
